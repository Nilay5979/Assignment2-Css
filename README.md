# Assignment2-Css
This is the webpage for the lyrics of my favourite song 
I have made it look attractive by adding some effects in it by using transition and transform property of css.
So,when we take the cursor to the verse 1 of the lyrics it comes in the front and the box shadow increases which looks like a 3D model
and also attached a link of the lyrics webpage from where I copied the lyrics to redirect to that website click on "Lyrics of the song".
